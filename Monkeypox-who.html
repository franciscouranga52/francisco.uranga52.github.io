				<b> "We cannot exclude" </b>
				<p> The transmission of monkeypox to other population groups, warned a report from the Health Department of United States, which reports that health services are conducting an "active search"; for cases. The WHO has also reported that the virus is being sequenced in different cases to see if they are related.</p>

				<b> How is the Monkey Pox spread? </b>
				<p> The disease, identified for the first time in monkeys, does not spread easily among people, so experts assure that the risk for the population is low and an expansion like that of the COVID-19 pandemic was not expected. <br>
				In order to become infected, close contact with infectious material is necessary. It can occur by touching the skin lesions, like those of chickenpox, which appear on infected persons, but also by "respiratory droplets in prolonged face-to-face contact" or through contaminated objects.</p>
